        <H2>
            Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperatur
            e has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, 
            or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1880—the year that accurat
            e recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees
             Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981
             , however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For 
             the last 40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature
              rise by 0.18 degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.
            The result? A planet that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10 
            warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2005—and the 5
             warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015. Climate
              change deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a 
              “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but numerous studies,
               including a 2018 paper published in the journal Environmental 
               Research Letters, have disproved this claim. The impacts of 
               global warming are already harming people around the world.
            
            Now climate scientists have concluded that we must limit global
             warming to 1.5 degrees Celsiusby 2040 if we are to avoid a 
             future in which everyday life around the world is marked by
              its worst, most devastating effects: the extreme droughts,
               wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and other disasters that 
               we refer to collectively as climate change. These effects are
                felt by all people in one way or another but are experienced 
                most acutely by the underprivileged, the economically marginalized,
                 and people of color, for whom climate change is often a key driver
                  of poverty, displacement, hunger, and social unrest.
